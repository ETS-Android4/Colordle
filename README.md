# **Welcome to Colordle!**
A fun spin on the classic Wordle game, but with colors! Guess the color's hex code to win the game!

## Rules
You are presented a color and you must guess the 6-character hex code that produces that color.
Each guess will show you if you got the correct character, the correct one in the wrong spot, or just the wrong character.
You have six total guesses!
See "How to Play" in the main page for more information.
Note: When submitting a guess, you must backspace to the first square if you wish to edit your submission.
      Likewise, you must fill in your entire guess if you wish to backspace and edit.
      Something we're still working on!

## Run Colordle
Colordle was developed with Java and Android Studio, and will run on most Android devices. If you do not have an Android device, you can utilize 
the emulator built into Android Studio or find an Android emulator online.
